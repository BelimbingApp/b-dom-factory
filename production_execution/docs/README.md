# Factory Production Execution

Phase 1 records orders or batches and completed routed operations. The public
facade is `Bilimbi.Factory.ProductionExecution`. The module declares its
Inventory production posting authority in `mix.exs` application metadata.

Create an order with `create_order(scope, company_id, attrs)`. Attributes are
`code`, `kind` (`"order"` or `"batch"`), `product_id`,
`formula_version`, `routing_version`, and optional opaque `demand_ref`.
The exact pair of revisions is validated through Product Definition and
retained on the order and every execution.

Use `complete_operation(scope, company_id, order_id, source, attrs)` for
both live commands (`source: :live`) and historical imports
(`source: :import`). Attributes are:

- `request_id`: company-unique retry key. Identical retries return the
  original execution; conflicting retries fail.
- `operation_code`, `resource_id`: a step in the selected routing and
  one of its allowed physical resources.
- `operator_type`, `operator_id`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `evidence`:
  who did the work, when, and its source record. Both times are UTC DateTimes;
  a late import keeps its historical completion time as Inventory's effective
  time and gets a separate recorded time.
- `inputs`, `outputs`: actual lines with `item_id`, `location_id`,
  positive `quantity`, `observation`, and optional `unit_id`,
  `conversion_version`, `evidence`, and `output_role`. Items must belong to
  the selected operation. Inventory validates stock, units, and conversions.
- `variance`: optional Inventory transform evidence with `evidence` and
  `reconciliation_basis`; required when actual inputs and outputs differ.

The facade posts through Inventory's named production functions, carrying
opaque execution, order/batch, and resource references. Execution and material
effects use one Repo transaction, so neither survives a failure in the other.
Material holds and overrides and the production trace view are later phases.
